\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Summary of report D1.1}

\Ac{QMCkl} aims at providing a high-performance
implementation of the main kernels of \ac{QMC} methods. 
\ac{WP}~1 focuses on defining the \ac{API}, the tests,
and a \emph{pedagogical} presentation of the main algorithms.
In \ac{WP}~3, the \ac{HPC} experts use this repository as a reference for re-writing
optimized versions of the functions proposed in this pedagogical version of the library.

To maximize the portability to unknown architectures, we have chosen to provide an \ac{API} which
is compatible with the C programming language. The foundations of the library are written in C, but Fortran
was chosen to express the kernels as it is more convenient than C for expressing linear algebra.
The dependencies to external software are kept minimal to facilitate the installation, and the
BSD 3-clause license was chosen to facilitate the adoption of the library by industrial 
collaborators.

As this version version of the library is intended to be mostly used as documentation, 
we chose to use literate programming\cite{knuth_1992} in {\orgmode}
format.\cite{schulte_2012,orgmode} The documentation
is first written, and the code illustrates the documentation. From the same source files,
the documentation is generated both in text and HTML formats, as well as the C code of the library.
This practice helps the documentation to always be consistent with the code.

The documentation of the current status of the library is available
at \url{https://trex-coe.github.io/qmckl}, and the source code is
available on the GitHub repository at \url{https://github.com/trex-coe/qmckl}.

\subsection{QMCkl's objective}

\newcommand{\Nelec}{N_{\text{elec}}}
\newcommand{\Nelecup}{N_{\text{elec}}^\uparrow}
\newcommand{\Nelecdn}{N_{\text{elec}}^\downarrow}
\newcommand{\br}{\mathbf{r}_1,\dots,\mathbf{r}_{\Nelec}}
\newcommand{\brup}{\mathbf{r}_1,\dots,\mathbf{r}_{\Nelec^\uparrow}}
\newcommand{\brdn}{\mathbf{r}_{\Nelec^\uparrow+1},\dots,\mathbf{r}_{\Nelec}}

The most common form of wave function used in \ac{QMC} simulations is
expressed as a linear combination of Slater determinants $D_I$ multiplied by
a Jastrow correlation factor $\exp(J)$:
\begin{equation}
  \Psi(\br) = \left( \sum_I c_I\, D_I(\br) \right) \exp \left( J(\br) \right).
\end{equation}

The Slater determinants are be expressed as products of
$\uparrow$-spin $\downarrow$-spin determinants:
\begin{eqnarray}
D_I(\br) = D_i^\uparrow(\brup)\, D_j^\downarrow(\brdn),
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Nelec = \Nelecup + \Nelecdn$ is the number of
electrons, the sum of of the numbers of up- and down-spin electrons.

The determinants are built in a basis of \acp{MO},
\begin{equation}
  D_i^\uparrow(\brup) = \left|
    \begin{array}{ccc}
      \phi_{i(1)}(\mathbf{r}_1) & \dots & \phi_{i(\Nelecup)}(\mathbf{r}_1) \\
        \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      \phi_{i(1)}(\mathbf{r}_{\Nelecup}) & \dots & \phi_{i(\Nelecup)}(\mathbf{r}_{\Nelecup}) 
    \end{array}
    \right|
\end{equation}
and each determinant differs from the other ones by the indices $\{
i(1), \dots, i(\Nelecup) \}$ of the \acp{MO} composing it.
